IQ] How to access tomcat server from PC?

NOTE: default port number for tomcat server is 8080.

 http://65.2.129.199:8080  ---> directly you cant access without enable that port number     				in security group.

  select the server --> go to security --> scroll down --> click on security group ---->
  click on edit in-bound rules ---> click on add rule ---> select custom tcp ---> give port 8080 ----> select anywhere ipv4 ---> save the rules.

Then reload this url http://13.233.32.177:8080

click on server Status, Manager App, Host Manager ----> not able to access.

  <user username="kk" password="password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

  <user username="mahesh" password="mahesh" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

IQ] How to change port number and why we need to change the port number?

scenario: I need to install tomcat & Jenkins in the same server.

ANS: tomcat port number is 8080 and Jenkins port number also 8080 --> Then we are getting port conflict . [java.net.BindException we will get] , so that we are changing the port numbers.


step 1: goto conf directory.

    cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.91/conf

step 2: open server.xml
   
    goto line number 71 and change the port.

step 3: stop the tomcat server and start the tomcat server.

step 4: now try to access with different port number.

NOTE: please make sure to enable the port in Security groups.
